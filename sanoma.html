          <h3>Making the invisible painfully visible</h3>
          <p>As you might have guessed already, a lot of these problems above are happening constantly in the background, so it's hard to even realise they're a nuisance that can be dealt with. To get buy in, we did an audit to make the invisible painfully visible. In a nutshell, we went through the UI (designs and coded product) with a fine tooth comb. After close inspection of the product, we found:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>30+ unused or redundant color styles</li>
            <li>Dozens of inaccessible or conflicting type styles</li>
            <li>55+ components with outdated or broken design</li>
            <li>Wildly varying ways of working in Figma and code</li>
            <li>Almost every component had missing interaction states</li>
            <li>Limited responsiveness guidelines and no grid system</li>
            <li>Inefficient use of Figma features like auto layout and constraints</li>
            <li>Non responsive designs → confusion when implementing</li>
            <li>Inconsistent file hygiene practices (layer naming, context grouping, grouping, user flow formatting)</li>
            <li>No standard format for documentation</li>
            <li>Figma file structure was hard to navigate</li>

        <div class="col-md-6 mt-5">
          <p>So how do we fix all this? The easy answer is to jump right into it, go back to atomic design basics and start redefining primitives and so on. But that wasn't what I did. My first step was to download and study as many open source professional design systems as I could. Below are the top 7 design systems I learned the most from:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://atlassian.design/">Alassian</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://spectrum.adobe.com/">Spectrum</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/">IBM Carbon</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/">Polaris</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://atlassian.design/">Mailchimp</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/user-engagement/patterns/">Lightning</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>However, I'd recommend you go hunting on your own, especially <a href="https://www.designsystemsforfigma.com/">here</a>. Firstly, design systems are a fast moving space and there's innovation every other week. Secondly, there were grains of gold to pull from in every single design system I studied. By the end of the project, I ended up having downloaded and used elements from over 50 different design systems in our design system. <br><br> I got a shortcut and benefited from the expertise of companies who had way more resources to pump into design and testing for their design system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 mt-5 mb-5">
          <p>Once I had studied all those design systems, I had a pretty good idea of what the final component library in Figma would look like, and what basic components are common to all digital products. I also had a pretty big list of custom components that would need to be built or rebuilt from the UI deconstruction phase of the audit.<br><br>Armed with those, I built a dummy design system file in Figma. Essentially this was an approximation of the final design system with generic components and styles from Material and iOS libraries, that I could modify or replace with Sanoma's versions over time as I redesigned them. <br><br> This allowed me to show the other designers and developers a good idea of what they were going to eventually get when the final system was ready. It also allowed me to show them concrete examples of what I was looking for when I asked them questions about Sanoma's product or ways of working.</p>

        <h3>Defining reusable properties</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 mt-5">
          <p>Once I had a good base file ready to receive the output, I focused on redefining primitives and eliminating redundant styles from our documentation. Primitives are the basic building blocks of a digital interface: colors, icons, fonts, spacing, effect styles, corner rounding, spacings, grids and so on. This phase is very important. The best guides on the topic are <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/space-grids-and-layouts/">here</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-1-typography-7c630d9092bd">here</a>, <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/iconography-guide/">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/10-practical-steps-to-create-a-predictable-accessible-and-harmonious-typography-system-a-case-6c85d901bedd">here</a>. <br><br> Tip: Do NOT move on to components until you're very sure you have a good foothold on the primitives. While modern tools like Figma make it easier to update components once primitives change, it's still a massive pain to do so, and keep all the new info in your head. Haste makes waste. <br> <br> Once you think you've defined them as well as you can, do a quick comparison with your component inventory from the audit phase. Do you think you could build every single component you see out of what you have defined? If no, you have work to do. </p>

        <h3>Onwards to components</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 mt-5">
          <p>Components are UI patterns that can (and should) be reused across the entire product. In our design system, we defined two major types: global components and page specific components. You probably recognise most of the global components, which are things like buttons, text inputs, form controls and so on. <br><br>However, our page specific components are custom designed for Kampus. An example would be the control panel for the readspeaker that reads out the text content for students with disabilities or people who prefer to listen instead of read. A lot of the page specific components actually are made up at least partially of the global components <br> <br> Componentization is important for three reasons. When you have well defined UI patterns, designers stop reinventing the wheel, users start to get used to repeated design patterns and developers avoid a lot of work implementing and reimplementing components. <br><br> Be careful to pay attention to every interaction state of your components. For example, here's one of our dropdowns, hilariously named 'dropdown-simple'</p>

          <p>
            One of the best ways to standardise designs is to make templates for the other designers to use. In a nutshell, if you're very opinionated about the optimal layout of your beautiful components, you can maximise the chances of other people agreeing if you give them ready made templates of the major screen types in your product, with all the new components and styles already in place. <br><br> One big reason for old components and styles worming their way back in after a design system renewal is that people go back modify old files quickly when a minor update is needed, instead of redesigning all the screens with the new components.

          <p>
            There's no point standardising your ways of working if you don't also spend some time trying to harmonise how different designers and developers work in the same file. Small things like different ways of naming components or organising artboards (frames) can stack up and create a difficult to navigate mess in every file. It's also harder and harder to onboard new employees, because there's no standard way of working to train them in. <br><br> Fixing this was one of my highest priorities at Sanoma. I benchmarked processes at Google and Adobe to come up with some standard rules for organising Figma files, documented them and organised trainings for the other designers.

          <p>
            A figma component library is a great first step, but to truly push the ways of working forward, it was always the plan to implement a <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> so that devs could develop and test components in isolation. While I was there, our amazing developer Richard ported a representative sample of all the components in the component library into Sanoma's first Storybook. They are now working on implementing the rest of the renewed components and templates to the Storybook. <br><br> Note: We always knew that the Storybook and Storybook Docs was the end goal for the design system, so the Figma library was designed to make it easy to move things over. I heavily recommend discussing and defining your DS tech stack before you start designing.
